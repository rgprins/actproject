This directory contain two files:
codebook.MD which describes the variables that are in the resultant tidydata file
run_analysis.R which is the syntax which loads the data, merges it, drops irrelevant values and produces a tidy dataset with aggregated means of the measured variables

Note: the workingdirectory of R needs to be set to the main directory for this data (there are then thus 2 sub directories: train and test)
